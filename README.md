# Student score Prediction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that predicts the score of a student based on the number of hours they study. The project is implemented using Python and various libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the score of a student based on the number of hours they study. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model can learn from a dataset of student scores and study hours, and make predictions on unseen data.

The project is implemented using Python programming language and employs popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning algorithms.

Requirements
To run this project locally, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn


Model
The model used in this project is a simple linear regression model. Linear regression is a popular algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. In this case, the number of hours studied is the input feature, and the score is the target variable.

The model is trained on the provided dataset to learn the relationship between study hours and scores. It then uses this knowledge to make predictions on new data.

Results
After training the model, the notebook will display the evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (RÂ²) to assess the model's performance.

Additionally, the notebook will provide visualizations such as scatter plots and regression lines to visualize the relationship between study hours and scores.
